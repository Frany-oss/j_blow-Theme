# Theme inspire by the great Jonathan Blow (j_blow) color scheme he has on emacs.  
## Is not the same, but is a really nice low contrast and easy-to-the-eyes theme.
Also, this is mainly for C++, Rust, Java and even Python if you like few colors in your theme, but it can be use for other languajes sush as Js, Ts, Go, etc.

If you like a theme with the same pallet of colors, so your eyes feel relax and you can stay for hours in your monitor, this theme is for you!! 
At first the background color may shock you (because is not common) but in a few minutes you will see that is a really nice comination with the rest of the theme.

I hope you like it!!  :)
